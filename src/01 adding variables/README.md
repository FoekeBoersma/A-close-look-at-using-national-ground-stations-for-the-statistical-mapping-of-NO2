## 01 adding variables to initial datasets

Scripts that relate to this map process the additional predictors with the purpose of assigning predictor information to the measurement stations. 
Additional predictors consist of:
  * Building density
  * NDVI
  * Precipitation
  * Traffic volume

Assigning complementary predictor variables is done for both the global and local dataset. The relevant input data is defined in the config.yaml file, also located in the folder "01 adding variables".
